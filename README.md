After working on this for more than 3 days I finally completed the script part of the project. It's been very challenging but also very useful to get aquainted with the language. I feel like I understand everything I've applied here a little more, especially functions and the for loop, to an extent. 

I still need to work on comments, as I don't really use them as much as I should.
