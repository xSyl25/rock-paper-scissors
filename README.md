After working on this for more than 3 days I finally completed the script part of the project. It's been very challenging but also very useful to get aquainted with the language. I feel like I understand everything I've applied here a little more, especially functions and the for loop, to an extent. 

I still need to work on comments, as I don't really use them as much as I should.

Rewriting the code seemed intimidating at first, but somehow I got past the assignment without asking for help or googling much! And while I did have to think really hard at times, it helped me learn quite a bit about breaking problems down into smaller ones. Not to mention my grasp on the scopes and functions is also getting a little better.
I found working with the event listeners to be the most challenging part. I'll have to look more into them so I don't struggle as much as I did here in the future. Hopefully they click soon!
